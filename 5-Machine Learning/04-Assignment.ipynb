    "- Most data can be categorized into 4 basic types from a Machine Learning perspective:\n",
    "- Numerical Data\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Numerical data is any data where data points are exact numbers. Statisticians also might call numerical data, quantitative data.\n",
    "  - This data has meaning as a measurement such as house prices or as a count, such as a number of residential properties in Los Angeles or how many houses sold in the past year.\n",
    "  - Numerical data can be characterized by continuous or discrete data. Continuous data can assume any value within a range whereas discrete data has distinct values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Categorical Data\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Categorical data represents characteristics, such as a hockey player’s position, team, hometown.\n",
    "  - Categorical data can take numerical values.\n",
    "  - For example, maybe we would use 1 for the color red and 2 for blue.\n",
    "  - But these numbers don’t have a mathematical meaning. That is, we can’t add them together or take the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time-Series Data\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Time series data is a sequence of numbers collected at regular intervals over some period of time.\n",
    "  - It is very important, especially in particular fields like finance.\n",
    "  - Time series data has a temporal value attached to it, so this would be something like a date or a timestamp that you can look for trends in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text Data\n",
    "  - Text data is basically just words.\n",
    "  - A lot of the time the first thing that you do with text is you turn it into numbers using some interesting functions like the bag of words formulation.\n"
